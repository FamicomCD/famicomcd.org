Mode 0 allows for 4 layers at once rather than the usual 2-3 layers found in SMW by using Mode 1, but it will cause all layers to be 2BPP or 4 colors per tile (this does not include sprite layers and they retain usage of 16 colors)."

Those who left their towns to find out what was going on were never heard from since.<br><br>Amidst the chaos caused by the Guardian's sudden outburst, the locals called upon the one and only Mario Bros. to help them.
