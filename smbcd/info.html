				Super Mario Bros. CD (SMBCD) is a ROM hack of Super Mario World, imagining what an SMB game might be like on a CD-based console. SMBCD is for the FamicomCD, a fictional add-on for the Famicom/NES. 
				<br><br>
				SMBCD utilizes the <a href="https://www.zeldix.net/t1607-msu1-getting-started-guide">MSU1</a> chip to deliver original and rich CD-quality music, fully animated cutscenes, and more complex environments, even on original hardware via the SD2SNES/FXPak Pro. SMBCD also heavily utilizes <a href="https://sneslab.net/wiki/Mode_0">Mode 0</a> (a SNES background mode, akin to <a href="https://sneslab.net/wiki/Mode_7">Mode 7</a>) for its levels, providing additional layers for foreground elements and background parallax.

				The year is 1987. The NES/Famicom is seeing immense popularity hot off the success of the console and many of its titles during this period. Nintendo had released Super Mario Bros. 2 (known as <q>The Lost Levels</q> in the west) and published many popular action games the previous year.
				<br><br>
				Concurrently, the Super Famicom was in development and announced that year by the President of Nintendo. However, Nintendo wished to still support the original, now aging Famicom. This would become the FamicomCD, a CD-ROM based add-on that would be able to utilize CDs to load video games, presented as a cheaper entry point for existing Famicom users into the <q>next generation</q>. This would be a very ambitious endeavor, so to sell the system, it was requested that a technologically improved Super Mario Bros. must be able to be played on this device.
				<br><br>
				However, as Hiroshi Yamauchi said in September 1987, <q>Super Mario Bros. 4</q> and many other titles were already in the planning stages for the next version of the Famicom, which left <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Research_%26_Development_1">Nintendo Research & Development Group #1</a> to be the ones to develop the Super Mario Bros. game for FamicomCD rather than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Research_%26_Development_4">Research Group #4</a> (who had worked on a lot of the previous entries and eventually "Super Mario World"), with assistance from Team Shikamaru for much of the planning and some parts of development. The game would look familiar to Super Mario Bros. players, but feature vibrant, colorful, and stunning visuals that weren't possible on the original Famicom, and sounds that were unlike anything from before.
				<br><br>
				It was initially planned to make the music of the game match the sound aesthetic of the Famicom games but with higher fidelity instruments, however the new CD spec meant that music was no longer limited by the sound polyphony and synthesis abilities of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricoh_2A03">Famicom's 2A03 chip</a>. There were virtually no limitations in place, sounds could be as rich and full as they could ever sound. This led the production of the music for Super Mario Bros. CD to spin off into being a much more ambitious project, with more musicians and instrumentalists involved to truly make the music take advantage of the new technology.

				<p class="supporttabnamebottom">The Archipelago of Brixurei</p>
				<div class="supportcontentbar"></div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="installguidetextholder">
				The Archipelago of Brixurei is composed of 10 islands that are officially part of the Brixurei nation, most with different climates or features that are suitable to only certain creatures. The main island of the archipelago is the Central Isle.
				<br><br>
				Ever since settling began in the archipelago 700 years ago, there have been myths and legends of a guardian hidden deep within one of the many islands of the Archipelago of Brixurei. It is said that the guardian keeps the entire archipelago at peace; poor weather, harvests, or illness is attributed to the guardian being upset. The islands which are affected must make offerings to the guardian to regain her favor.
				<br><br>
				Nowadays, the Archipelago of Brixurei is a hot tourist spot, especially during the summer months where a tropical vacation is necessary. Although officially endorsed tourism only came about 25-30 years ago when an archipelago-wide democratic government was instated, the economy of the archipelago now hinges heavily on tourism, largely in part due to merchandise sales and trading. Tourists are rarely allowed onto any island other than the Central Isle as other island’s climates are deemed too harsh for tourism to safely occur.
				<br><br>
				With this newfound tourism wealth in recent years, many Brixurians had begun constructing and living in sparse towns. The destructive nature of urban construction caused the government to pass laws banning further expansion of any kind of urban architecture. Only two major towns exist within the whole archipelago, both located in the East Central Isle. The move to sparse towns left many villages, temples, and the belief in the Guardian of Brixurei dwindling at a worrying speed.

				<div class="supportcontentbar"></div>

			<div class="installguidetextholder">
				One morning, the Mushroom Kingdom had received a frantic letter from the Archipelago of Brixurei’s government regarding Bowser’s forceful occupation and threatened ravaging of the nation. Within the hour Mario and Luigi receive the letter through forward mail, and they set off for the archipelago, rushing there in a small motor boat, riding through the night...

			<div class="installguidetextholder">
				<div class="questions">How do I install SMBCD?</div>
				You can install SMBCD by following one of the <a href="https://famicomcd.org/smbcd/installation">Installation Tutorials</a>. If you have any trouble with installation, feel free to contact us via <a href="https://discord.gg/wpSGt5aTuw">Discord</a> or <a href="mailto:support@famicomcd.org">email us</a>!
				<br><br>
				<div class="questions">Will there be multiplayer?</div>
				SMBCD will not have multiplayer in any capacity due to the way we intend players to experience our game. However, we are looking into different playable characters.
				<br><br>
				<div class="questions">Is SMBCD inspired by Sonic CD?</div>
				Contrary to popular belief, SMBCD is not inspired by Sonic CD. SMBCD takes more inspiration from surrealist fantasy, Nintendo's Research and Development 1 (R&D1), music of the 80s (artists such as Masayoshi Takanaka and T Square), among other influences.
				<br><br>
				This also indirectly means that SMBCD and Sonic CD will not share many features, at least not intentionally (e.g. no time travel).
				<br><br>				
				<div class="questions">Will Nintendo take down SMBCD?</div>
				In short: Probably not. You can visit our <a href="https://famicomcd.org/about#copyright">copyright</a> page for more information.
