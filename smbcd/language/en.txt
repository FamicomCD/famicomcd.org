The CD based console in this situation is the FamicomCD, which is a fictional add-on for the Famicom/NES and is not the Super NES CD, which some people seem to mix up."

strid "deprecated_smbcd_tagline2"
string "SMBCD utilizes the MSU-1 chip to deliver original and rich CD-quality music, fully animated cutscenes, and more complex environments, even on original hardware via the SD2SNES/FXPak Pro! SMBCD also heavily utilizes Mode 0 (a SNES background mode, akin to Mode 7) for its levels, providing more layers for foreground environments and background parallax. Mode 0 allows for 4 layers at once rather than the usual 2-3 layers found in SMW by using Mode 1, but it will cause all layers to be 2BPP or 4 colors per tile (this does not include sprite layers and they retain usage of 16 colors)."

strid "deprecated_smbcd_story1"
string "SMBCD takes place upon the small yet diverse Archipelago of Brixurei. One day, mysteriously, The Guardian of Brixurei â€” the primary source of protection and security for the archipelago â€” had gone mad, resulting in adverse weather and upset wildlife to run rampant. Locals were left baffled and worried. Those who left their towns to find out what was going on were never heard from since.<br><br>Amidst the chaos caused by the Guardian's sudden outburst, the locals called upon the one and only Mario Bros. to help them. As the Mushroom Kingdom wished farewells, Mario set off by boat towards the Archipelago of Brixurei, bringing Luigi along for the ride. In this journey, the brothers will also meet a new friendly face who will accompany them."

strid "deprecated_tutorial_note2"
string "MSU-1 is the main way that SMBCD delivers its rich CD quality audio among other features that a real Super NES would struggle with, and as such MSU-1 is required for SMBCD to start. If you're missing MSU-1 or haven't installed it correctly, SMBCD will not start. If you have followed the guide and installed all the required MSU-1 files but SMBCD still will not start, check if your emulator supports MSU-1 or join the FamicomCD Discord for support."

It was originally created to share mockups of games and software that could've have been on the FamicomCD console/add-on, and soon Super Mario Bros.
