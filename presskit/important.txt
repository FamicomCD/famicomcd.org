# FamicomCD Branding

The FamicomCD name is to be formatted as "FamicomCD" unless it is absolutely necessary to shorten it, in which "FCD" is acceptable. Unapproved variations include "Famicom CD" and "Family Computer CD".



# Super Mario Bros. CD 

The Super Mario Bros. CD project name can be formatted as "Super Mario Bros. CD", "SMBCD", or "SMBCD". Please refrain from excluding any words from the title (such as the omission of "Super" or "Bros."). You may begin abbreviating as "SMBCD" once the full title has been written or mentioned once within your text. 

Please exclusively use promotional material included from the FamicomCD "Super Mario Bros. CD Press" and Branding Kit unless otherwise permitted by the Super Mario Bros. CD Team.
